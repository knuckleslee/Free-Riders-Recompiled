@echo off
rem Runs the benchmark on this PC and leaves a copy that is safe to send to others.
rem   run_benchmark.bat speed        baseline against the polling it replaced for suspended guests, 6 rounds
rem   run_benchmark.bat pipelines    a new player first race, with and without the prepared pipelines
rem   run_benchmark.bat exe          two builds, sfr_cpu_diagnostic_a.exe against _b.exe, in the same rounds
rem   run_benchmark.bat report       what limits this PC: as it is, without drawing, at half resolution, 4 rounds; send the -shareable zip
rem   run_benchmark.bat full         the whole report, unattended (about 45 minutes): what each part costs and the limit (Time Attack), then a race's frame rate; one zip to send
rem   run_benchmark.bat parts        what each part costs a frame: no drawing, half resolution, no sound output, main thread unpinned, 4 rounds (add solo)
rem   run_benchmark.bat profile      where the main thread's time goes, with and without drawing, 2 rounds (add solo); profile.md stays on this PC
rem   run_benchmark.bat ctrl         a control: the same build twice, to see what the method says about no difference
rem   run_benchmark.bat speed 8      the same with 8 rounds
rem   run_benchmark.bat author       the original's own unconfirmed switches: constant upload reuse, priority, host timing
rem   run_benchmark.bat speed 2 nostretch   the menu words by presents alone (cannot finish on a fast PC)
rem   run_benchmark.bat exe 6 solo  whether a change helps: a Time Attack (no rivals) stepped 1/60 s a frame, the same race frames every run
