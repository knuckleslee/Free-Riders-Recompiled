rem   run_benchmark.bat pipelines    a new player first race, with and without the prepared pipelines
rem   run_benchmark.bat exe          two builds, sfr_cpu_diagnostic_a.exe against _b.exe, in the same rounds
rem   run_benchmark.bat ctrl         a control: the same build twice, to see what the method says about no difference
rem   run_benchmark.bat rt           the render thread on (the default) against off, the same build
rem   run_benchmark.bat par          every guest thread in parallel (SFR_PARALLEL_WORKER=all) against the default
rem   run_benchmark.bat speed 8      the same with 8 rounds
rem   run_benchmark.bat author       the original's own unconfirmed switches: constant upload reuse, priority, host timing
rem   run_benchmark.bat speed 2 nostretch   the menu words by presents alone (cannot finish on a fast PC)
