// come out as wide as the emulated player's, which keeps the title's gesture
// detectors in the range they were tuned against by the pad emulation.

// False when the model was not confident enough about the torso for the rest
// to mean anything, and the joints are left alone.

// A camera faces the player, so the player's right hand is on the picture's
// left, and the sensor's +x -- the side the title's cursor centre sits on --
// is that same side. Some cameras hand over a mirrored picture instead (phone
// apps that show you yourself usually do), and nothing in the picture says
// which it is: a mirrored person looks exactly like a person. So it is asked
// for rather than guessed, and the picture is turned back the right way round
// before anything is measured from it.
