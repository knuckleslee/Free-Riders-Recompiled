// The model reads every picture on its own, and when a hand passes in front
// of the body, or an arm leaves the picture, it still names a place for it:
// a guess, often on the wrong side of the body or half a metre away. Played
// as it is, that guess is a gesture nobody made.
//
// So each limb point (elbows, wrists, knees, ankles) is checked against what
// a body can do before it is believed:
//   - the model's own confidence in it (models that give a world pose
//     report a visibility; the older picture-only ones are not asked);
//   - the length of the bone to it, against the length that bone has had for
//     this player: a forearm does not grow by half from one picture to the
//     next;
//   - how far it moved since the last picture: farther than a hand can go is
//     a jump, unless it stays there, which a real fast movement does.
// A point that fails is held where it was relative to the joint it hangs
// from, carried on by the speed it had, slowing, so a hidden hand moves with
// the arm and the body it belongs to. After a quarter of a second the model
// is believed again whatever it says: holding longer would freeze a limb that
// really is where the model puts it.
//
// It runs on the points as the model gives them, before PoseSmoothing, so a
// jump is taken out instead of being smoothed into a slide.
