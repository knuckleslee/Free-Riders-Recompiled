// The 1 Euro filter (Casiez, Roussel and Vogel, 2012): a low-pass whose
// cutoff rises with how fast the point is moving. Standing still is smoothed
// hard, so the cursor settles; a real movement raises the cutoff at once, so
// pointing does not lag behind the hand. Two numbers decide it -- the cutoff
// at rest, and how much speed raises it.
