"""Sums up the race frames of benchmark runs (scripts/benchmark.ps1).

Each run is a game log, stderr of sfr_cpu_diagnostic, with one NATIVE_PRESENT
line a frame. Only the frames of the race count (racing=1), less the first
--skip of them (the countdown, and shaders and pipelines made on first use).
A frame's time is the gap between its present and the one before.

    python scripts/benchmark_summary.py out/bench/<run> [--skip 600]

prints a table per configuration and writes it to <run>/summary.md.

The same number of frames is a shorter stretch of the race for a faster
setting, and the start of a race (the countdown, the first straight) is
lighter than what follows, so the frame-count table flatters whichever is
faster (+43% where the same seconds of the race gave +18%, on an i5-3470). A
second comparison counts the frames of one stretch of race time, the same for
every run: from --window-start seconds after the race began to the end of the
shortest run's race, at most --window-end.

Two more sections read the frame metrics as a report on this PC: where the
main thread's frame time goes, and, when the run has baseline, skip-draws and
render-50 (run_benchmark.bat report), what limits the frame rate here. The
summary opens with the PC itself: what info.txt recorded (benchmark.ps1 and
scripts/hardware_probe.ps1) and the adapter the game's own log says it drew
with, so summary.md is the whole of a performance report.
